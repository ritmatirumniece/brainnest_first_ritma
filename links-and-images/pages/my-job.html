    <h2>My job</h2>
    <p>I have been teacher for more than 30 years and I could say this is the most wonderful profession in the world. Yoy always feel young and do different interesting things together with your students.</p>
    <p>I had different duties at my work:
        <ul>
            <li>I was a teacher;</li>
            <li>I was a teacher- trainer;</li>
            <li>I was an international project coordinator;</li>
            <li>I was a new program (IB MYP)coordinator.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I haven't count how many students I had been taught. Wherever I go, I meet them everywhere. In summers I use to organize parties with my graduates.</p>

    <p>During the pandemic when the schools were closed, I participated in the national project where the teachers recorded their lessons in national TV. <a href="https://www.tavaklase.lv/video/reading-strategies/">ðŸ‘‰ Here</a> is the link of one of my lessons. I have 6 recorded lessons. Those, who are interested, you can find lesson plans and all materials <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nWMpsikcC8W9XStgH80tpCR5UdIv46B8?usp=sharing">here.ðŸ‘ˆ</a></p>
    <p>While I was working at school, I manage different kind of <a href="http://www.jsg.lv/projekti/">international projects.</a> Most of them were mobility projects and my students had apossibility to travel a lot and experienced different culture.</p>
    <p>My last professional challenge was to implement internationally recognized programme <a href="https://www.ibo.org/">International Baccalaureate. </a> I was a programme coordinator, educated my colleagues, create materials and study plans. </p>
