    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time I usually like doing different kind of things for relaxing. They should be different. So, my hobbies are:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>knitting and chrocheting</strong></li>
            <p> These hobbies are from my childhood. My grandmother taught me.Since that time I have made thousands of jumpers, socks, scarves, mittens, shawls etc. These are my latest works. Socks for my mentor Uldis and shawl is designed by wonderful woman, youtuber and designer from Iceland <a href="https://tinnacrochet.com/">Tinna Thorudottir Thorvaldar.</a> I have just insired from her.</p>

            <br> <br>

            <li><strong>reading</strong></li>
            <p>I am not a fast reader. I like the slow reading process when I can enjoy the written text and see it as a movie in my eyes. I need a real book in my hands. I hate reading on different devices. But I like audio books when I am knitting or chrocheting. I usually read before I go to sleep. At the moment I am finishing the sixth book of book series "Seven Sisters".These books are about adopted sisters where they are descovering their stories of their families. </p>

            <li><strong>gardening</strong></li>
            <p>I live in a private house that is why gardening is a part of my summer job. I do not have a perfect garden, but I grow berries,vegetables and flowers</p>
